# CFD2021-G4-Projects

This repository dedicates to the team projects
related to the CFD course, 2021 spring, at SAS, THU.  
Efforts are contributed by a joined 4-member group.  
For practice and performance, we attempt to use the
[Julia](https://julialang.org) programming langrage in these projects.
Projects are listed as below:

## Project 1

Analytical and elliptic grid generation
for geometrical and general setups.

### TODOs:
- [ ] General purpose solver for the inverted Poisson equation. (see ``gauss-seidel.jl`` from ``CFD-Julia``)
- [ ] Processing general [NACA airfoils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil)
      (formula generation, discretization, splining, etc.)
- [ ] Port the output to standard [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info) format.
